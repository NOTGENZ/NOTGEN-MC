## 🔍 Honest Review of Notgen  
**Notgen is a well-crafted texture pack designed for Minecraft Bedrock Edition (MCPE).** It stands out because of:  

✅ **Performance Optimization** – Smooth gameplay with a stable FPS.  
✅ **Balanced Aesthetics** – Looks great without being too heavy on resources.  
✅ **PvP-Friendly Design** – Some textures are tweaked for better visibility in fights.  

### ⚠ Things to Consider:  
- ❌ *Not the most FPS-boosting pack* – While it stabilizes FPS, some extreme low-end devices may still struggle.  
- ❌ *No Radical Texture Changes* – It keeps things close to vanilla, so if you prefer a complete overhaul, this might not be for you.  

### 💡 **Overall Verdict:**  
If you want a pack that enhances performance while keeping Minecraft's original charm, **Notgen is a solid choice**.  
However, if you’re looking for **extreme FPS boosts or a fully retextured game**, you might need something else.
