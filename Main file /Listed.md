## **🔍 Honest Review of Notgen**  

Notgen is a **well-crafted** texture pack designed for **Minecraft Bedrock Edition (MCPE)**. It stands out because of:  

✅ **Performance Optimization** – Smooth gameplay with a stable FPS.  
✅ **Balanced Aesthetics** – Looks great without being too heavy on resources.  
✅ **PvP-Friendly Design** – Some textures are tweaked for better visibility in fights.  

### **Things to Consider:**  
⚠️ **Not the most FPS-boosting pack** – While it stabilizes FPS, some extreme low-end devices may still struggle.  
⚠️ **No Radical Texture Changes** – It keeps things close to vanilla, so if you prefer a complete overhaul, this might not be the pack for you.  

💡 **Overall Verdict:** If you want a pack that enhances performance while keeping Minecraft's original charm, **Notgen is a solid choice**. However, if you’re looking for extreme FPS boosts or a fully retextured game, you might need something else.
